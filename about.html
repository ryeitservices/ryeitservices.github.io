      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Hi! I'm Henry. I'm a high school senior and run Rye IT Services. I founded Rye IT Services in 2024 after seeing a need for high-quality, inexpensive tech support that spreads knowledge. I've been interested in electronics since I was a toddler and love to repair things. My projects have included a drone, multiple MacBooks, PCs, and quite a few doorknobs. Beyond computers, I enjoy working on cars and spend plenty of time with my dog, Winston.</h3>
      <h3>I don't operate from a manual; instead, I take a holistic look at your issue, solve it, and explain how to prevent its reoccurance.</h3>
